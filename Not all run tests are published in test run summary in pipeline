Dear Sir/Madam, we have a problem with publishing test results. Some of them are missing in trx file. We use Visual Studio Test task for running UI tests in the TFS Release Pipeline.

I asked Azure DevOps team for help, but they recommended me to ask you. According to their findings the issue is in the trx where for the missing tests is a warning which is result it not being present in the trx. Please see the link to the Azure DevOps team answer below.

Would you be so kind to explore the issue and let me know where the problem is?
If you need any other information, please let me know.

Thank you in advance
Katerina Urbankova
